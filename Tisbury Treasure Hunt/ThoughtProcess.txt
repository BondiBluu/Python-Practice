Problem: organize treasure hunt information
Extract coordinates
Define get_coordinate(treasure, coordinate) and return only the extracted map coordinate 
Format coordinates
Define convert_coordinate() and takes the format of a coordinate and returns a certain format
Match coordinates
Define compare_record() 
Take a (treasure, coordinate) pair and (location, coordinate, quadrant) record from each.
Return true if the coordinate match
Reformat the coordinates as needed for an accurate comparison
Combine matched records
Define create_record()
Take a (treasure, coordinate) pair and (location, coordinate, quadrant) record and return (treasure, coordinate, location, coordinate, quadrant) ONLY IF the coordinates match.
If they don’t match, return “not a match”
Reformat the coordinates as needed for an accurate comparison
“Clean up” & make a report of all records
Define clean_up() 
Take a tuple of tuples (everything from both lists), looping through the outer tuple, dropping the unwanted coordinates from each inner tuple a and adding each to a ‘report’
